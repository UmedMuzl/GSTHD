# Gossip Stones Tracker HD (DK64 Edition) v0.1
Fork of Hapax (`Hapax#1729`)'s [fork](https://github.com/HapaxL/GSTHD) of Drekorig (`Drekorig#2506`)'s [Gossip Stones Tracker](https://github.com/Draeko/ootr_gst/tree/ladder_version) for the [Donkey Kong 64 Randomizer](https://dk64randomizer.com)

Bodged together by JXJacob for his own selfish purposes. Changes compared to GSTHD will be listed at a later time (once it is out of pre-release (once i squash some more bugs relating to broadcast view))

## Original README to follow.

I'm really sorry I haven't wrote any real tutorial yet to explain all the new (and old) stuff, I will write one soon!! In the meantime feel free to ask me about anything in here or (preferably) on Discord (`Hapax#1729`). Small tutorials for individual features are already partially available in the description of many of the releases (link above), be sure to check it out!

### What's new
#### Control scheme changes
- Left click "progresses" a UI element (e.g. greyed out Hookshot -> Hookshot -> Longshot). Applies to every UI element.
- Right click "regresses" a UI element (e.g. Longshot -> Hookshot -> greyed out Hookshot). Applies to every UI element.
- No cycling (e.g. left-clicking the Longshot does not reset it to a greyed-out Hookshot anymore).
- Middle click resets a UI element to its default value (including WotH/Barren panels, dungeon names, collected items, etc).
- You can now choose which button to use for drag & drop (default is middle click, options include left, right, middle, and left+right click).
- Added a minimum mouse movement threshold for initiating a drag & drop (value `MinDragThreshold` can be changed in settings).

#### New features
- You can now set a button for autocheck drag & drop (initiating a drag & drop using that button will automatically progress the item/song/medallion being dragged).
- A menu bar was added for quick access to some settings. Can be displayed or hidden with F10.
- Mouse wheel can now be used to progress and regress icons (applicable to progressive items, collected items, and dungeon names). Direction can be inverted or not.
- New "Gossip Stone grid" UI element that can be used to add Gossip Stones in bulk to a layout.
- Drag & dropped icons can now be moved around again from Gossip Stone to Gossip Stone (or to a Song's small icon).
- Medallions can now be drag & dropped.
- Collected items have been overhauled:
  - Layouts now have the option to place the amount number to a different place within a collected item's icon.
  - Layouts now have the option to set a maximum amount for a given collected item.
  - Collected items can now be drag & dropped.
  - Collected item number can now be reset to 0 with middle click.
  - Collected item number can now be set to increase/decrease by a set amount (e.g. 10 by 10) instead of 1 by 1.
- Layouts can now specify default image sets for song markers and Gossip Stones, as well as default dungeon names for medallions.
- It is now possible to add labels to a layout (for aesthetic purposes).
- It is now possible to add generic (no autofill) text boxes to a layout.
- Layouts can now set the order of dungeon names under medallions, as well as the starting value.
- Different behaviours for Song Markers are now available (`None`, `CheckOnly`, `DropOnly`, `DropAndCheck`, `DragAndDrop`, `Full`).
- Path Goal boss icons (for the newly-introduced Goal Hints) have been added. It is possible to change the amount of Path Goals that will be displayed per WotH line. Thanks to Baelnog#5969 for the code and Damien#8474 for the boss icons.
- The amount of Gossip Stones per WotH line can now also be changed.
- It is now possible to set the same WotH location more than once (thanks to GOGETA#0968).
- Majora's Mask icons have been added to a `mm` subfolder (thanks to Acrophobic#6464 and lolaway#4521).

#### Other changes and fixes
- Fixed small issues with collected items' number display.
- Fixed Song icons being flattened when drag & dropped.
- Fixed drag & drop on small Song icons to correspond to Gossip Stone behaviour.
- Changed default WotH colors, added togglable "Last WotH" color (right click on a white WotH).
- Fixed other small UI/UX details.
- Fixed some behaviours with Song Markers.
